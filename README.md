This study is dedicated to examining the mortality rate of COVID-19 before the introduction of vaccines, after the vaccine’s initial rollout, following the administration of the first booster shot, and post-implementation of the second booster shot. We seek to examine

“How have mortality rates for COVID-19, pneumonia, and their combination evolved across different time periods, specifically before the vaccine (prior to December 2020), after the introduction of the vaccine and before the first booster (December 2020 - October 2021), and after the introduction of the vaccine and before the second booster (October 2021 - April 2022) and after the second booster (April 2022-present)?”

This research aims to examine the impact of vaccination and booster shots on mortality rates, both for COVID-19 and pneumonia, and to understand the interplay between these variables over time. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of these parameters, we aim to gain deeper insights into the evolving impact of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccination strategies in averting severe outcomes. Such insights are essential for guiding public health policies and interventions to better manage this ongoing crisis.
